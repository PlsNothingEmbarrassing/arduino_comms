## Simulating Fibre optic communication to trigger arduino behaviour
Arduino is communicated with via a light sensor and LED to simulate fibre optic communication. This includes accounting for delays in communication and start/end transmission bits.
Certain patterns trigger mini projects already designed for the arduino such as the reading from a potentiometer or tilt switch.
